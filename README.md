# This repository is for the basic Python projects related to cybersecurity.

# The first one is a port scanning tool like Nmap which scans the target IP address and gives all the details about the open ports 

# The second is a Python-based web application firewall that detects SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) and blocks the requests.
# This waf works on basic payloads on sqli and xss like ("'", '"', "--", "/*", "*/", " OR ", " AND ") and
# ("<script>", "</script>", "javascript:", "<img", "<iframe", "<svg").
